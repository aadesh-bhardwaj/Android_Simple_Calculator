# 📱 Android CI with Harness — End-to-End Documentation  
### *(Build, Test, Publish to GCS)*

This document explains your Android Continuous Integration setup in **Harness**, including how to **reproduce it from scratch**, and what each field in your final **YAML pipeline** does.

> **Note**: CD/distribution is intentionally skipped. This CI pipeline:
> - Builds a **Debug APK**
> - Runs **JUnit unit tests**
> - Uploads the APK to **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**

---

## 🚀 What This Pipeline Does (At a Glance)

1. Clones your Android repo via **Harness Codebase connector**.
2. Builds a **Debug APK** with Gradle inside a container preloaded with Android SDK + JDK.
3. Runs **JUnit tests** and publishes results to the Harness UI.
4. Uploads the APK to:
   ```
   gs://atmosly-tfstate-atmosly-439606/harness/test/<pipeline-sequence-id>/
   ```
5. (Optional) Triggered automatically on Git push.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- A **Harness account**, project, and organization.
- The following **connectors** configured:
  
  | Purpose             | Connector Name       | Notes |
  |---------------------|----------------------|-------|
  | Git Repo            | `SimpleCalc`         | GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket |
  | Kubernetes Cluster  | `test101`            | Cluster with a delegate |
  | Docker Registry     | `stupido_saurus`     | Needed if image is private |
  | GCS Storage         | `GCS_Connector`      | Write access to GCS bucket |

- Repo structure:
  ```
  Calculator/
    └── app/
    └── gradlew
  ```
- Gradle config for reliable test runs in `app/build.gradle`:
  ```groovy
  android {
    testOptions {
      unitTests {
        includeAndroidResources = true
        returnDefaultValues = true
      }
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
  }
  ```

## 🔧 Reproducible Setup Steps

### 1. Create the Connectors

- **Codebase**: OAuth or token-based access to your repo.
- **Kubernetes**: Install a Harness delegate (stage uses namespace `imported`).
- **Docker**: Only needed for private images.
- **GCS**: Use a Service Account JSON with `Storage Object Admin` permission.

---

### 2. Add the Pipeline

- In Harness, go to your **CI project** → Pipelines → **Create new**.
- Paste the YAML (below) into the pipeline editor.
- Save.

---

### 3. (Optional) Create a Trigger

- UI → Triggers → Git Provider
- Event: **Push**
- Add **branch filter** → Select this pipeline.

---

## ▶️ How to Run & Validate

### Manual Run
- Click **Run**, provide input (branch, PR, or commit).
- Watch logs:
  - ✅ APK build successful
  - ✅ JUnit test results appear
  - ✅ APK uploaded to GCS

### Validate Outputs

- **Harness UI → Tests tab**: JUnit results.
- **GCS**: Folder `harness/test/<sequenceId>/` contains `app-debug.apk`.

---

## 🧼 (Optional) Post-Run Cleanup

- Remove test artifacts from GCS.
- Scale down/remove delegate if it was created just for this CI pipeline.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Tips

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| **ImagePullBackOff** | Ensure Docker connector + permissions are valid |
| **Gradle Cache not working** | Set `GRADLE_USER_HOME=/harness/gradle` in step `envVariables` |
| **Tests not visible** | Ensure XML path is correct & `testDebugUnitTest` is run |
| **Upload fails** | Check GCS_Connector permissions & `sourcePath` |
| **OOM errors** | Increase `resources.limits.memory` to 6–8Gi |

## 🧾 What’s Out of Scope

> CD, Approval steps, Firebase/TestFlight upload.

This CI pipeline skips distribution. If needed later, we can provide a Firebase CLI deployment step with secret integration.

---

## 🧩 Appendix: Optional Enhancements

- **Static Analysis**: Add `./gradlew lint` as a step.
- **Test Coverage**: Integrate Jacoco & upload XML to Harness.
- **Matrix Builds**: Parallel flavors via strategy matrix.
- **Advanced Versioning**:
  ```yaml
  target: "tictactoe/<+pipeline.sequenceId>/<+codebase.branch>/<+pipeline.startTs>/"
  ```

---

## ✅ Summary

You now have a fully working Harness CI pipeline that:

✅ Builds a consistent **Android Debug APK**  
✅ Runs **JUnit tests** and surfaces results in UI  
✅ Uploads the artifact to **GCS** with versioned paths  
✅ Can be **auto-triggered** on Git push
